# Statistical-Insights-into-Semmelweis-Handwashing-Legacy
###Project Overview
This project, titled "Semmelweis' Revelation: A Data-Driven Case Study on the 1840s Handwashing Breakthrough," is an in-depth exploration of the groundbreaking discovery by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis in the 1840s, which led to the implementation of handwashing in medical practice. Through a combination of statistical analysis and historical data examination, this study aims to shed light on the pivotal role of data in driving one of the most significant advancements in medical hygiene.

###Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze historical data surrounding childbed fever mortality rates before and after the introduction of handwashing protocols by Dr. Semmelweis. By conducting t-tests and exploring data distributions, we seek to quantify the impact of this simple yet revolutionary practice on reducing mortality rates and to understand the statistical significance of Semmelweis' findings.

###Key Features
Historical Context: The project delves into the historical background of childbed fever, the medical practices of the time, and Dr. Semmelweis' observations that led to his hypothesis.

####Data Analysis: Utilizing Python's data analysis libraries (e.g., pandas, scipy), the project performs statistical tests (t-tests) to compare mortality rates before and after the implementation of handwashing.

####Statistical Significance: The project evaluates the statistical significance of the observed differences in mortality rates, providing insights into the effectiveness of handwashing in reducing infections.

####Visualization: Various data visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, box plots) are used to illustrate the distributions and trends in the data, making the findings more accessible and understandable.
